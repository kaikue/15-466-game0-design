<h1>Dungeon Dilemma</h1>
<p>A turn-based, grid-based puzzle game about slaying goblins in a dungeon.</p>

<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<p><strong>Start:</strong> Levels are generated by stepping backward from a 
solved board. The player starts in a random central location, and moves in 
reverse by one space per turn. Each turn, a goblin has a chance to be created 
where the player is facing. All existing goblins move away from the player in a 
random available direction. If a goblin is stuck in a corner and cannot move 
further from the player, the level generation completes and the gameplay begins.</p>
<p><strong>Movement:</strong> Movement happens in turns. Each turn, the player 
can attack (see Combat) or move one space. They can move up, down, left, or 
right on the 6 by 6 grid, constrained by walls. The player then faces in the 
direction that they moved (so a move up will leave the player facing towards the 
top of the screen). After the player attacks or moves, the goblins all move by 
one space. They try to move closer to the player, stepping up, down, left, or 
right to close the distance.</p>
<p><strong>Combat:</strong> If the player presses space, they perform an attack move. 
If there is an adjacent goblin on the tile they are facing, that goblin is slain 
and becomes a harmless pile of bones. If there is no goblin on that tile, they 
do not hit anything. Attacking takes a turn, so all goblins move by one space 
regardless of whether the player hit anything or not.</p>
<p>If a goblin moves onto the player's tile, the player is slain, and the level 
restarts.</p>
<p><strong>Finish:</strong> If the player slays all goblins in a level, the 
level is won, and a new level is generated.</p>
