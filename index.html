<h1>Dungeon Dilemma</h1>
<p>A turn-based, grid-based puzzle game about slaying goblins in a dungeon.</p>

<p>The game takes place on a 6 by 6 tile grid populated with one player and 
several goblins. The player moves between tiles using the arrow keys, and can 
attack with the spacebar. Goblins move towards the player after the player moves 
or attacks, and the player must slay all the goblins and avoid being slain 
themselves.</p>

<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<p><strong>Start:</strong> Levels are generated by stepping backward from a 
solved board. The player starts in a random central location, and moves in 
reverse by one space per turn. Each turn, a goblin has a chance to be created 
where the player is facing (if it is a valid empty space), causing the player 
not to move that turn. All existing goblins move away from the player in a 
random available direction. If a goblin is stuck and cannot move further from 
the player, the level generation completes and the gameplay begins. (Forcing the 
goblins to move each turn ensures the level is possible, since when the level is 
played non-reversed, those goblins would move toward the player immediately.)</p>
<p><strong>Movement:</strong> Movement happens in turns. Each turn, the player 
can attack (see Combat) or move one space. They can move up, down, left, or 
right on the 6 by 6 grid, constrained by walls, using the arrow keys. The player 
then faces in the direction that they moved (so a move up will leave the player 
facing towards the top of the screen). After the player attacks or moves, the 
goblins all move by one space. They try to move closer to the player, stepping 
up, down, left, or right to close the distance. Goblins cannot share a grid 
space.</p>
<p><strong>Combat:</strong> If the player presses space, they perform an attack move. 
If there is an adjacent goblin on the tile they are facing, that goblin is slain 
and becomes a harmless pile of bones. If there is no goblin on that tile, they 
do not hit anything. Attacking takes a turn, so all goblins move by one space 
regardless of whether the player hit anything or not.</p>
<p>If a goblin moves onto the player's tile or vice versa, the player is slain, 
and the level restarts.</p>
<p><strong>Finish:</strong> If the player slays all goblins in a level, the 
level is won, and a new level is generated. Levels continue indefinitely until 
the user quits.</p>
